# Noise
 Project for documenting noise generation methods using Simplex Noise (Simplex Noise generator was sourced from github).

### Fractal Brownian Motion
Uses multiple layers of Simplex Noise to create more natural looking/smoother noise fields.

### Domain Distortions
Layers fbm whiles adding small distortions (there are more than a few ways to achive this). Number of layers can be varied to produce natural to abstract noise fields.
